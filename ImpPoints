1  if u want to run core-service, run docker compose up core-service
2. But since core-service need mysql connection, run this first : docker compose up -d mysql rabbitmq(optional)
3. if u don't want that hectic add this in docker-compose file :
depends_on:
  -sql
  -rabbitmq

4. if u want to run core-service, run docker compose up email-service(this already has depends on added)
-----------
Run Infra Separately (Professional Way)

First start infra:
docker compose up -d mysql rabbitmq
Then run:
docker compose up core-service
Since infra is already running, Docker won’t recreate them.
