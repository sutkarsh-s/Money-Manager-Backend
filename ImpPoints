1  if u want to run core-service, run docker compose up core-service
2. But since core-service need mysql connection, run this first : docker compose up -d mysql rabbitmq(optional)
3. if u don't want that hectic add this in docker-compose file :
depends_on:
  -sql
  -rabbitmq

4. if u want to run core-service, run docker compose up email-service(this already has depends on added)

Run Infra Separately (Professional Way)

First start infra:
docker compose up -d mysql rabbitmq
Then run:
docker compose up core-service
Since infra is already running, Docker won’t recreate them.

REGARDING RABBITMQ:
IMP: run email service first then core(yet to figure out the rreson for solving this issue)
Fix for the PRECONDITION_FAILED
Right now the error still means: one declaration of profile-activation-queue has x-dead-letter-exchange='', and another declaration has no x-dead-letter-exchange at all.
To eliminate this completely, I’ve changed the setup so that:
Only email-service (the consumer) declares the queue and DLQ.
core-service (the publisher) no longer declares any queues at all – it just uses RabbitTemplate to send to the queue by name.
